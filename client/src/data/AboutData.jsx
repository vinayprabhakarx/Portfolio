export const bioText = `
My name is Vinay Prabhakar, a Bachelor of Computer Applications student with a strong interest in web development and machine learning. I focus on building full-stack applications using the MERN stack.

In machine learning, I work primarily with Python, using libraries such as scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy. I have experience developing classification models and implementing basic computer vision techniques.

Currently, I’m engaged in projects that apply machine learning to real-world problems, including a disease prediction system and a cleanliness rating tool.

My objective is to begin my career in the IT industry and advance as a Machine Learning Engineer, dedicated to building intelligent, practical solutions.
